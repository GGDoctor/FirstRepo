Lab 4 Jacob Franco and Sellers

As of this moment we have only done up to part 3 of the required code.

Known bugs at this current moment are:
1. The weapon does have a muzzle flash effect look at the players chest. Code does work and flash does play but for some reason the flash is bound to the characters chest.
2. The dwarf and character do have attack and death animations bound to themselves. The animations were playing when we initally finished part three. Do to some unforseen mistakes when attempting part 4 of this lab the animations broke and for some reason you do not get attcked or die. 

To run this code please download the required file from Git.
From the file unzip the solution and open the Unreal Project.
If the project does not open try opening it from the editor.

If your character does not accept input on pressing play then click inside the editor 
Sometimes the keys do not accept input at game start.
