Lab 4 Jacob Franco and Sellers

As of this moment we have only done up to part 3 of the required code.
We are working on finishing part 3 so that the dwarf and player can die.

Known bugs at this current moment are:
1. Dwarf Character does not have a blueprint attached to it. This is most likely caused by an error in a push.
2. The weapon does have a muzzle flash effect look at the players chest. Code does work and flash does play but for some reason the flash is bound to the characters chest.

To run this code please download the required file from Git.
From the file unzip the solution and open the Unreal Project.
If the project does not open try opening it from the editor.

If your character does not accept input on pressing play then click inside the editor 
Sometimes the keys do not accept input at time
